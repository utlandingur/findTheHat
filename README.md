# Find The Hat Game 
This is a simple find the hat game using the terminal, written in JS.

Field constructor creates two-dimensional array representing the “field” itself
A field consists of a grid containing “holes” (O) and one “hat” (^).
We use a neutral background character (░) to indicate the rest of the field itself.
The player’s initial location and their path is represented by *.

The player must move around the field and find the hat without falling down a hole or going out of bounds.

After the first game is completed the player is invited to generate their own randomised field with a size of their choice.

All logic can be found in Main.JS
